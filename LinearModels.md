# Linear Models

## Chapter 2 Estimation
1. What does linear mean?

Ans: Parameters enter linearly

2. Estimating coefficients (beta)

Ans: Least Square Estimation / Gauss-Markov Theorem (errors are uncorrelated, have equal variance and i.i.d. Normal) - Best Linear Unbiased Estimate

* Other estimators: 

(1) Generalized Least Squares when errors are correlated or have unequal variance 

(2) Robust estimates when the error distribution is long-tailed

(3) Biased Estimators when predictors are correlated.

3. Goodness of Fit

Ans: R^2 = 1 - RSS/Total SS (percentage of variance explained)

## Chapter 3 Inference

1. Hypothesis Tests to Compare Models: F-statistics
2. Testing Examples: Test of all predictors: F-statistics, Testing one predictor: two models(full vs. left-out)-F-statistics, or t-statistics, Testing a pair of predictors: F-statistics
3. Permutation Tests

## Chapter 4 Prediction

1. Confidence Intervals for Predictions
2. CI for a future response
3. CI for a mean response
