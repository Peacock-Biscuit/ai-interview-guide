# 40 Questions for Prodcut Questions

## Introduction

* Business Goal should be into a metric (You should provide a metric to optimize for)
* How to choose a metric for a new feature, product or even a department: starting from the high level company goal -> User Retention -> User Engagement -> Metric X 
* Metrics need a time threshold in order to be evaluated.
* Improve a product Case: focus on actions that incentivize users and users are already performing today.
* Should we implement X or How to improve Z: explaining step by step how you would find answers. (Test how you approach a problem)
* Optimizing a long term metric, like retention: find a short term metric that can predict the long term one and then focus on optimizing that one.
* Picking variables: pick a combination of user characteristics(age, sex, country) and behavioral ones(related to their browsing behavior)

### How would you improve engagement on FB?

(Template for general case study questions)
* What is the definition of engagement -> the proportion of users who take at least one action per day -> action -> interacting with this site
* Pick the variables which move that metric -> User Characteristics + behavior
* Pick a model to predict metric (Consider model pros and cons)
* Explain a couple of possible model output scenarios (Try to have one good and bad segaments)
* Define next steps -> improve the metric

### We are launching a new driver app with a better UI. The goal is increasing driver earnings by increasing their number of trips. Outline a testing strategy to see if the new app is better than the old one

* Check if you can simply randomly split users -> new product has a bug/users use a new app 24/7
* First, state why you can't split users randomly
* Second, decide to test by market
* Third, determine a smaple size by a t-test
* Fourth, after sample size is reached, check if results are significant
